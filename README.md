## Vision

Melody envisions a revolutionary music ecosystem where artists and listeners connect directly, free from traditional intermediaries. Our platform empowers creators to share their art while building genuine communities around music, all secured by the power of blockchain technology.

## Problem Statement

### A Fragmented Music Industry

The current music landscape faces critical challenges that limit both artists and music enthusiasts:

- **Artist Suppression**: Traditional platforms take substantial revenue cuts, leaving artists with minimal compensation for their creativity
- **Limited Discovery**: Emerging artists struggle to reach audiences due to algorithmic bias favoring established names
- **Centralized Control**: Platform owners dictate terms, content policies, and revenue distribution without artist input
- **Lack of Community**: Listeners remain passive consumers with limited ways to support and interact with their favorite artists

## The Melody Solution

Melody transforms the music industry by creating a decentralized platform built on Starknet, where artists maintain control and listeners become active community members.

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract System

Melody is built on three interconnected smart contracts deployed on Starknet:

#### 1. **Artist Contract** (`IArtistContract`)
Manages artist registration, song uploads, and collaboration features:
- Artist profile creation and management
- Song upload and metadata handling
- Collaboration system for multi-artist tracks
- Comprehensive artist statistics and analytics

#### 2. **Song Contract** (`ISongContract`)
Handles song interactions, engagement, and social features:
- Like and comment systems
- Song statistics and popularity tracking  
- User engagement rewards
- Pagination and batch operations for scalability

#### 3. **User Contract** (`IUserContract`)
Manages user profiles, rewards, and favorite artists:
- User registration and profile management
- Token-based reward system
- Artist favoriting and discovery
- User activity tracking

### Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Starknet for scalable, low-cost transactions
- **Smart Contracts**: Cairo language for robust contract development
- **Architecture**: Modular design with separate concerns for scalability
- **Token System**: Native reward mechanism for user engagement
