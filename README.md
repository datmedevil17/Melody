## Problem Statement

### A Fragmented Music Industry

The current music landscape faces critical challenges that limit both artists and music enthusiasts:

- **Artist Suppression**: Traditional platforms take substantial revenue cuts, leaving artists with minimal compensation for their creativity
- **Limited Discovery**: Emerging artists struggle to reach audiences due to algorithmic bias favoring established names
- **Centralized Control**: Platform owners dictate terms, content policies, and revenue distribution without artist input
- **Lack of Community**: Listeners remain passive consumers with limited ways to support and interact with their favorite artists

## The Melody Solution

Melody transforms the music industry by creating a decentralized platform built on Starknet, where artists maintain control and listeners become active community members.

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract System

Melody is built on three interconnected smart contracts deployed on Starknet:

- Artist profile creation and management
- Song upload and metadata handling
- Collaboration system for multi-artist tracks
- Comprehensive artist statistics and analytics

#### 2. **Song Contract** (`ISongContract`)
Handles song interactions, engagement, and social features:
- Like and comment systems
- Song statistics and popularity tracking  
- User engagement rewards
- Pagination and batch operations for scalability
